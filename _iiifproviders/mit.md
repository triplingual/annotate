notes: To get IIIF image click on the download drop down on the object page. Click any of the sizes, a new window with a URL will open up. Make sure that url has `/full/full/0/default.jpg`. So for the 'Large image size' link, `https://iiif.mitmuseiiif.com:8182/iiif/2/CF-38-045.jp2/full/!2000,2000/0/default.jpg` should become `https://iiif.mitmuseiiif.com:8182/iiif/2/CF-38-045.jp2/full/full/0/default.jpg`. Then it can be used with the [Create annotations on any image]({{site.baseurl}}/imageditor/) functionality. As with all these resources be mindful of rights.
