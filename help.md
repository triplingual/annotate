This section has instructions on how to create a GitHub pages site, how to run the server locally, how to create annotations, how to use the embed code, etc.

* ['Quickstart']({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}/running-locally) gives instructions on how to run the annotation server locally. All steps after this are for deploying or serving the annotations. All the other pages are optional. You do not need to follow these steps if you are planning on deploying the Flask server to Heroku.
* ['Creating Annotations']({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}/creating-annotations) gives instructions on how to create annotations through the two different interfaces.
* ['Creating GitHub website']({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}/creating-github) gives instructions on how to host GitHub website through GitHub pages. This allows for the annotations to be shared publicly.
* ['Deploying to Heroku']({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}/heroku) gives instructions on how to deploy the Flask server to Heroku. It assumes that the Jekyll site is going to be deployed to GitHub pages. If this is done you will not need to follow the instructions for 'Running Locally'
* ['How to user "embed code"']({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}/instructsembed) explains how to use the embed code on other websites and provides links to custom settings.
* ['Using your own images']({{site.baseurl}}{{page.url}}/usingimages) explains how to load images into the site and gives instructions on making and hosting IIIF images on this site.
